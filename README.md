# 🌾 Agri-AI: Plant Disease Detection

**Agri-AI** is a deep learning project focused on detecting plant diseases from leaf images using computer vision techniques.  
It leverages a custom **ResNet-like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture trained on agricultural datasets to classify plant health with high accuracy.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/revanthkumar257/Agri-AI.git
cd Agri-AI
````

### 2. Python Environment

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r agri_ai_final/requirements.txt
pip install -r agriai/requirements.txt
```

### 3. Running the Backend

Run one of the available entry points:

```bash
python agri_ai_final/api.py
# or
python agri_ai_final/run_app.py
# or
python agri_ai_final/start_backend.py
```

*(Update this section if your entry point differs.)*

### 4. Frontend (Optional, Archived)

Requires **Node.js 18+**:

```bash
cd agri_ai_final/archived/agrinew-main/
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 📦 Models & Datasets

### What’s Included

* Application code and metadata
* `.gitignore` configured to exclude large files (datasets, models, logs, node_modules)

### What’s Excluded (must be placed locally)

* **Datasets** → place under:

  ```
  agriai/Plant_leave_diseases_dataset_without_augmentation/
  ```
* **Trained models / checkpoints** → place under:

  ```
  agri_ai_final/models/final_model.keras
  ```
* **TensorBoard logs & checkpoints** → remain in their respective folders (ignored by Git)

📌 To distribute models/datasets:

* Upload them to cloud storage (Google Drive, S3, etc.) or a GitHub Release
* Add the download link in this README

---

## 📝 Notes

* Large artifacts are intentionally excluded to keep the repo lightweight and avoid Git LFS.
* Use the Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/137WIkw3wW4mebUUvjUSQlCkZunJytane for the full dataset, trained models, and logs.
* This structure ensures contributors can run the code without multi-GB pushes.

## 🚀 Future Work

* 🌐 Deploy model using Flask/Streamlit + React
* 📊 Integrate with IoT devices for real-time field detection
* 📈 Retrain continuously with new agricultural datasets
